abstract = {General conditional independence models for d observed variables, in terms of p latent variables, are presented in terms of bivariate copulas that link observed data to latent variables. The representation is called a factor copula model and the classical multivariate normal model with a correlation matrix having a factor structure is a special case. Dependence and tail properties of the model are obtained. The factor copula model can handle multivariate data with tail dependence and tail asymmetry, properties that the multivariate normal copula does not possess. It is a good choice for modeling high-dimensional data as a parametric form can be specified to have O (d) dependence parameters instead of O (d2) parameters. Data examples show that, based on the Akaike information criterion, the factor copula model provides a good fit to financial return data, in comparison with related truncated vine copula models. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Joint models for longitudinal and survival data are often used to investigate the association between longitudinal data and survival data in many studies. A common assumption for joint models is that random effects are distributed as a fully parametric distribution such as multivariate normal distribution. The fully parametric distribution assumption of random effects is relaxed by specifying a centered Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (CDPMM) for a general distribution of random effects because of some good properties of CDPMM such as inducing zero mean and continuous probability distribution of random effects. A computationally feasible Bayesian case-deletion diagnostic based on the divergence is proposed to identify the potential influential cases in the joint models. Several simulation studies and a real example are used to illustrate our proposed methodologies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In view of that there exist complicated correlations among failure modes of the stochastic structure because of the same uncertain variables that are contained in different failure modes, many reliability analysis methods based on empirical probability model have been developed to calculate and assess the structural reliability. However, the empirical distributions of uncertain variables are not always available or not accurate. Thus, based on the available sample data of random variables of the stochastic structural system to be analyzed, this paper presents a new reliability analysis method in which the mixed Copula is constructed to describe the correlations among multi-failure modes. First, the Gumbel Copula and Clayton Copula, which have the upper and lower tail dependence separately, are utilized to construct a mixed Copula so as to describe the correlations among multi-failure modes. Then, the sample data of the random variables is substituted into the performance functions of failure modes to calculate the sequence values thereof, and the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of each performance function of the structure are estimated by using the nonparametric kernel density estimation (NKDE) technique. Subsequently, the Canonical Maximum Likelihood (CML) method is applied to estimate the correlation parameters in the mixed Copula. Finally, the main girder structure of an overhead traveling crane is investigated by using the proposed method, and the results indicate that the new reliability analysis method is effective and valid. Compared with traditional reliability analysis methods, the new method, in which the available sample data of random variables is directly used to calculate the values of performance functions so as to avoid the errors caused by empirical distributions, provides some important theories and engineering contributions for the reliability design analyses and safety assessments of actual engineering structures, especially these with complex correlations among multi-failure modes.},

The applications include the study of dependence and measures of association, and the construction of families of bivariate distributions. With nearly a hundred examples and over 150 exercises, this book is suitable as a text or for self-study. The only prerequisite is an upper level undergraduate course in probability and mathematical statistics, although some familiarity with nonparametric statistics would be useful.

First, our pair copula family selection procedure extends existing Bayesian family selection methods by allowing pair families to be chosen from an arbitrary set of candidate families. Second, our method represents the first Bayesian model selection approach to include the regular vine density construction in its scope of inference. The merits of our approach are established in a simulation study that benchmarks against methods suggested in current literature.

The model construction is hierarchical in nature, the various levels corresponding to the incorporation of more variables in the conditioning sets, using pair-copulae as simple building blocks. Pair-copula decomposed models also represent a very flexible way to construct higher-dimensional copulae. We apply the methodology to a financial data set.

Current sequential greedy approaches for structure selection require calculating spanning trees in hundreds of dimensions and fitting the pair copulas and their parameters iteratively throughout the structure selection process. Our method uses a connection between the vine and structural equation models. The later can be estimated very fast using the Lasso, also in very high dimensions, to obtain sparse models. Thus, we obtain a structure estimate independently of the chosen pair copulas and parameters. Additionally, we define the novel concept of regularization paths for R-vine matrices. It relates sparsity of the vine copula model in terms of independence copulas to a penalization coefficient in the structural equation models. We illustrate our approach and provide many numerical examples. These include simulations and data applications in high dimensions, showing the superiority of our approach to other existing methods.},

Our method is the first to jointly estimate the posterior distribution of all trees of a regular vine copula. This represents a substantial improvement over existing frequentist and Bayesian strategies, which can only select one tree at a time and are known to induce bias. A simulation study demonstrates the feasibility of our strategy and shows that it combines superior selection and reduced computation time compared to Bayesian tree-by-tree selection.

abstract = {Multivariate copulas are commonly used in economics, finance and risk management. They allow for very flexible dependency structures, even though they are applied to transformed financial data after marginal time dependencies are removed. This is necessary to facilitate statistical parameter estimation. In this paper we consider a very flexible class of mixed C-vines, which allows the variables to be ordered according to their influence. Vines are built from bivariate copulas only and the term 'mixed' refers to allowing the pair-copula family to be chosen individually for each term. In addition there are many C-vine structure specifications possible and therefore we propose a novel data driven sequential selection procedure, which selects both the C-vine structure and its attached pair-copula families with parameters. After the model selection maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the parameters is facilitated using the sequential estimates as starting values. An extensive simulation study shows a satisfactory performance of ML estimates in small samples. Finally an application involving US-exchange rates demonstrates the need for mixed C-vine models. {\textcopyright} 2012 SAGE Publications.},

Here, an alternative is proposed, where nonlinear serial and cross-sectional dependence is captured by a copula model. The copula defines a multivariate time series on the unit cube. A drawable vine copula is employed, along with a factorization which allows the marginal and transitional densities of the time series to be expressed analytically. The factorization also provides for simple conditions under which the series is stationary and/or Markov, as well as being parsimonious. A parallel algorithm for computing the likelihood is proposed, along with a Bayesian approach for computing inference based on model averages over parsimonious representations of the vine copula. The model average estimates are shown to be more accurate in a simulation study. Two five-dimensional time series from the Australian electricity market are examined. In both examples, the fitted copula captures a substantial level of asymmetric tail dependence, both over time and between elements in the series.},

Design/methodology/approach: Consider a life testing experiment in which a sample of n devices starts to operate at t=0 and the data are available on failure time and failure-evolving process on each individual, called in some contents wear or degradation. Ignoring the between performance characteristics dependency structure may lead us to different reliability estimations, while the dependency justly exists. In previous research, dependency between the degradation process and hard failure time has been studied in limited detail (special closed form expression). Thereafter, the dependency between two degradation processes with the same structure (gamma process) in a system is considered using the copula function. Findings: The results indicate that ignoring the dependency structure may lead us to different reliability estimations while the dependency justly exists. Originality/value: This study gives some contributions that evaluate reliability metrics with more than one failure mechanism that may not be independent and possibly follow a different distribution function.

	abstract = {Statistical inference in high dimensional dynamical systems is often hindered by the unknown dependency structure of model parameters. In particular , the inference of parameterized differential equations (DEs) via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers often suffers from high proposal rejection rates and is exacerbated by strong autocorrelation structures within the Markov chains leading to poor mixing properties. In this paper, we develop a novel vine-copula based adaptive MCMC approach for efficient parameter inference in dynamical systems with strong parameter interdependence. We exploit the concept of a vine-copula decomposition of distribution densities in order to generate problem-specific proposals for a hybrid independence/random walk Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampler. The key advantage of this approach is that the corresponding MH proposals generate independent samples from the posterior distribution more efficiently than common competitors. All copula densities can be updated during the sampling procedure for fine-tuning. The performance of our method is assessed on two small-scale examples and finally evaluated on a delay DE model for the JAK2-STAT5 signaling pathway fitted to time-resolved western blot data. We compare our copula-based approach to an independence sampler, a second-order moment-based random walk MH algorithm, and an adaptive MH sampler.},

	abstract = {Until recently, the vast majority of data mining time series classification (TSC) research has focused on alternative distance measures for 1-Nearest Neighbour (1-NN) classifiers based on either the raw data, or on compressions or smoothing of the raw data. Despite the extensive evidence in favour of 1-NN classifiers with Euclidean or Dynamic Time Warping distance, there has also been a flurry of recent research publications proposing classification algorithms for TSC. Generally, these classifiers describe different ways of incorporating summary measures in the time domain into more complex classifiers. Our hypothesis is that the easiest way to gain improvement on TSC problems is to simply transform into an alternative data space where the discriminatory features are more easily detected. To test our hypothesis, we perform a range of benchmarking experiments in the time domain, before evaluating nearest neighbour classifiers on data transformed into the power spectrum, the autocorrelation function, and the principal component space. We demonstrate that on some problems there is dramatic improvement in the accuracy of classifiers built on the transformed data over classifiers built in the time domain, but that there is also a wide variance in accuracy for a particular classifier built on different data transforms. To overcome this variability, we propose a simple transformation based ensemble, then demonstrate that it improves performance and reduces the variability of classifiers built in the time domain only. Our advice to a practitioner with a real world TSC problem is to try transforms before developing a complex classifier; it is the easiest way to get a potentially large increase in accuracy, and may provide further insights into the underlying relationships that characterise the problem.},

TSF employs a combination of entropy gain and a distance measure, referred to as the Entrance (entropy and distance) gain, for evaluating the splits. Experimental studies show that the Entrance gain improves the accuracy of TSF. TSF randomly samples features at each tree node and has computational complexity linear in the length of time series, and can be built using parallel computing techniques. The temporal importance curve is proposed to capture the temporal characteristics useful for classification. Experimental studies show that TSF using simple features such as mean, standard deviation and slope is computationally efficient and outperforms strong competitors such as one-nearest-neighbor classifiers with dynamic time warping. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Several alternative distance measures for comparing time series have recently been proposed and evaluated on time series classification (TSC) problems. These include variants of dynamic time warping (DTW), such as weighted and derivative DTW, and edit distance-based measures, including longest common subsequence, edit distance with real penalty, time warp with edit, and move–split–merge. These measures have the common characteristic that they operate in the time domain and compensate for potential localised misalignment through some elastic adjustment. Our aim is to experimentally test two hypotheses related to these distance measures. Firstly, we test whether there is any significant difference in accuracy for TSC problems between nearest neighbour classifiers using these distance measures. Secondly, we test whether combining these elastic distance measures through simple ensemble schemes gives significantly better accuracy. We test these hypotheses by carrying out one of the largest experimental studies ever conducted into time series classification. Our first key finding is that there is no significant difference between the elastic distance measures in terms of classification accuracy on our data sets. Our second finding, and the major contribution of this work, is to define an ensemble classifier that significantly outperforms the individual classifiers. We also demonstrate that the ensemble is more accurate than approaches not based in the time domain. Nearly all TSC papers in the data mining literature cite DTW (with warping window set through cross validation) as the benchmark for comparison. We believe that our ensemble is the first ever classifier to significantly outperform DTW and as such raises the bar for future work in this area.},

	abstract = {Objective: Daytime short nap involves individual physiological states including alertness and drowsiness. In order to have a better understanding of the periodical rhymes of physiological states and then promote a good interpretability of alertness, the aim of this study is to detect drowsiness during daytime short nap. Methods: A method of Bayesian-copula discriminant classifier (BCDC) was introduced to detect individual drowsiness based on the physiological features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. As an extension of traditional Bayesian decision theory, the BCDC method tries to construct the class-conditional probability density functions by exploiting the theory of copula and kernel density estimation. Results: The proposed BCDC method was validated with experimental dataset and compared with other traditional methods for drowsiness detection. The obtained results showed that our method outperformed other methods in terms of three evaluation criteria. Conclusion: Our proposed method is effective to detect drowsiness with superior performance. Additionally, the BCDC method is relatively robust to different parameter settings on the group-level dataset. Significance: The proposed method is likely to be a useful tool to improve the correctness of the estimated class-conditional probability density functions. Since features are extracted from spontaneous EEG recordings, the results of this study can be further generalized to other experimental environment to detect vigilance level or driver drowsiness.},

This paper presents two combination strategies of feature extraction on EEG signals. In the first strategy, Autoregressive coefficients and approximate entropy are calculated respectively, and the features are obtained by assembling them. In the second strategy, the EEG signals are first decomposed into sub-bands by wavelet packet decomposition. Wavelet packet coefficients are then sent to the autoregressive model to calculate autoregressive coefficients, which are used as features extracted from the original EEG signals. These features are fed to support vector machine for classifying the EEG signals. The classification accuracy has been used for evaluating the classification performance. Experimental results in five mental tasks show that the combination strategies can effectively improve the classification performance when the order of autoregressive model is greater than 5, and the second strategy is superior to the first one in terms of the classification accuracy.},

	abstract = {This study implements a regular vine copula methodology to evaluate the level of contagion among the exchange rates of six Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru) from June 2005 to April 2012. We measure contagion in terms of tail dependence coefficients, following Fratzscher's (1999) definition of contagion as interdependence. Our results indicate that these countries are divided into two blocks. The first block consists of Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and Mexico, whose exchange rates exhibit the largest dependence coefficients, and the second block consists of Argentina and Peru, whose exchange rate dependence coefficients with other Latin American countries are low. We also found that most of the Latin American exchange rate pairs exhibit asymmetric behaviors characterized by nonsignificant upper tail dependence and significant lower tail dependence. These results imply that there exists contagion in Latin American exchange rates in periods of large appreciations, whereas there is no evidence of contagion during periods of currency depreciation. This empirical regularity may reflect the "fear of appreciation" in emerging economies identified by Levy-Yeyati, Sturzenegger, and Gluzmann (2013).},

	abstract = {So-called pair copula constructions (PCCs), specifying multivariate distributions only in terms of bivariate building blocks (pair copulas), constitute a flexible class of dependence models. To keep them tractable for inference and model selection, the simplifying assumption, that copulas of conditional distributions do not depend on the values of the variables which they are conditioned on, is popular.We show that the only Archimedean copulas in dimension d ≥ 3 which are of the simplified type are those based on the Gamma Laplace transform or its extension, while the Student-t copulas are the only one arising from a scale mixture of Normals. Further, we illustrate how PCCs can be adapted for situations where conditional copulas depend on values which are conditioned on, and demonstrate a technique to assess the distance of a multivariate distribution from a nearby distribution that satisfies the simplifying assumption. {\textcopyright} 2013.},
