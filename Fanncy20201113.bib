abstract = {In this article, a new distribution, called $\alpha$ - transformed Generalized Exponential Distribution ($\alpha$PTGE) is proposed. The distribution has simple closed forms pdf and cdf. Several properties of the $\alpha$PTGE distribution are studied including unimodality, moments, conditional moments, stochastic ordering and Shannon entropy. The distribution is capable of monotonically increasing, decreasing, bathtub and upside down shaped hazard rates. Furthermore, we discussed several methods of estimation for estimating the $\alpha$PTGE($\alpha$,$\beta$,$\lambda$) parameters. In particular, we compare, through simulation study, the performance of the maximum likelihood estimation, maximum product spacing estimation, ordinary and weighted least-squares estimation methods. Also, the average interval lengths and coverage rates of 95{\%} confidence intervals, including boot-p and boot-t confidence intervals for different parameter values are provided. A real data set is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed distribution.},

abstract = {In life testing, the competing risks model is usually discussed under the assumption of independence. In this paper, we consider a dependent competing risks model using bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution in constant-stress accelerated life testing. To observe expected failure times and terminate the life tests around a predetermined time, the adaptive progressively hybrid censoring scheme is adopted. Based on the accelerated competing risks model with the adaptive progressively hybrid censoring scheme, we obtain the maximum-likelihood estimators, approximate confidence intervals, and bootstrap confidence intervals of unknown parameters. To test the independence between the bivariate competing risks and find the relationship of shape and scale parameters, we discuss the likelihood ratio tests for hypotheses of interest. In addition, we compute the maximum-likelihood predictors of unobserved competing risks times in the constant-stress accelerated life tests. Finally, a simulation study and an illustrative example are provided to support the proposed model and methods, and to examine the performance of estimators and testing.},

The dependent structure between competing risks is modeled by a Marshall-Olkin bivariate exponential distribution, and the accelerated model is described by the power rule model. The point and interval estimation of the model parameters and the reliability function under the normal usage condition at mission time are obtained by using the maximum likelihood estimation method and the bootstrap sampling technique. Moreover, the pivotal quantities based estimation are adopted to estimate the model parameters and the generalized confidence intervals. As a comparison, we also consider the Bayes estimation and the highest posterior density credible intervals for the model parameters based on conjugate priors and importance sampling method, respectively. To illustrate the proposed methodology, a Monte Carlo simulation is used to study the performances of different estimation methods. Finally, a dataset is analyzed for illustrative purpose and a comparison with the original results is also given.},

Considering the constant-stress and step-stress accelerated models, the explicit conditional density functions of order statistics under progressively Type-I hybrid censoring scheme are given to obtain the expected Fisher information matrix. By minimizing the asymptotic variance of the mean life under the use stress, the optimum test design is completed by determining the test units allocated to each stress in constant-stress accelerated life test and the changing time to severer accelerated stress in step-stress accelerated life test. Finally, an example is shown to illustrate the optimum test design. The numerical results show that the step-stress accelerated life test is a better choice.},

abstract = {Under constant stress accelerated test, we analyze the masked data from hybrid systems including series-parallel system and parallel-series system. The Bayesian posterior distribution and estimates of components' subsurvival functions are obtained by assuming a prior of the multivariate Dirichlet process. By establishing a relationship between subsurvival and survival functions of components, the estimates of reliabilities for components and system are derived from the estimates of subsurvival functions. It is not confined to the common restriction that the sets of discontinuity points of the survival functions have to be disjointed. For a complex system, we represent it to the proposed series-parallel system or parallel-series system. Thus, the nonparametric Bayesian approach is also applicable for the complex system with s-independent components. A simulated example is presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the method. Finally, the method is applied to a real data of coal wine monitoring power.},
