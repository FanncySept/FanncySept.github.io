Several properties of the $\alpha$PTGE distribution are studied including unimodality, moments, conditional moments, stochastic ordering and Shannon entropy. The distribution is capable of monotonically increasing, decreasing, bathtub and upside down shaped hazard rates. Furthermore, we discussed several methods of estimation for estimating the $\alpha$PTGE($\alpha$,$\beta$,$\lambda$) parameters. In particular, we compare, through simulation study, the performance of the maximum likelihood estimation, maximum product spacing estimation, ordinary and weighted least-squares estimation methods. Also, the average interval lengths and coverage rates of 95{\%} confidence intervals, including boot-p and boot-t confidence intervals for different parameter values are provided. A real data set is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed distribution.},

In this paper, we consider a dependent competing risks model using bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution in constant-stress accelerated life testing. To observe expected failure times and terminate the life tests around a predetermined time, the adaptive progressively hybrid censoring scheme is adopted. Based on the accelerated competing risks model with the adaptive progressively hybrid censoring scheme, we obtain the maximum-likelihood estimators, approximate confidence intervals, and bootstrap confidence intervals of unknown parameters. To test the independence between the bivariate competing risks and find the relationship of shape and scale parameters, we discuss the likelihood ratio tests for hypotheses of interest. In addition, we compute the maximum-likelihood predictors of unobserved competing risks times in the constant-stress accelerated life tests. Finally, a simulation study and an illustrative example are provided to support the proposed model and methods, and to examine the performance of estimators and testing.},

By minimizing the asymptotic variance of the mean life under the use stress, the optimum test design is completed by determining the test units allocated to each stress in constant-stress accelerated life test and the changing time to severer accelerated stress in step-stress accelerated life test.

The Bayesian posterior distribution and estimates of components' subsurvival functions are obtained by assuming a prior of the multivariate Dirichlet process. By establishing a relationship between subsurvival and survival functions of components, the estimates of reliabilities for components and system are derived from the estimates of subsurvival functions. It is not confined to the common restriction that the sets of discontinuity points of the survival functions have to be disjointed. For a complex system, we represent it to the proposed series-parallel system or parallel-series system. Thus, the nonparametric Bayesian approach is also applicable for the complex system with s-independent components. A simulated example is presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the method.

When the lifetime of components follows Weibull distribution, the problem of point and interval estimates are discussed from different perspectives. Under a general life-stress assumption that there are multiple nonconstant and stress-dependent scale and shape parameters, the maximum likelihood estimates of unknown parameters along with associated existence and uniqueness are established. Approximate confidence intervals are constructed correspondingly via expected Fisher information matrix. Furthermore, some pivotal quantities are constructed and alternative generalized point and interval estimates are also proposed for comparison. In addition, predictive intervals for the lifetime of the multicomponent system are discussed under classical and generalized pivotal approaches, respectively. The results show that the proposed generalized estimates are superior to the conventional likelihood approach in terms of the accuracy. A real data example is carried out to illustrate the implementations of the proposed methods.},
